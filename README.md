# weeplug

A collection of WeeChat Python scripts.

To make writing these scripts easier, `weeplug` provides the plumbing and helpers to
write them in an object-oriented style, and hides the gory (C) details of the Python plugin
as far as possible, like manual memory management and so-called ‘pointers’.
`weeplug` also makes it easy to use a Python virtualenv,
to provide your WeeChat scripts with external dependencies.
